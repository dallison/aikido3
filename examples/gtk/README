GTK+ examples
-------------

I didn't write these.  They are taken from the GTK+ release
and converted into Aikido.  They are provided purely
as examples of how to use the GTK package to write
GUI programs.

For copyright information about a specific example, see
the file of the same name in the GTK+ release.

You will need to set your AIKIDOPATH to tell the
interpreter where the GTK+ libraries are.  For
example, if the libraries are in /usr/local/lib/gtk:

% setenv AIKIDOPATH /usr/local/lib/gtk
