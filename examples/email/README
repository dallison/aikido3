Email sender GUI example
------------------------

This example is a GTK+ program that presents a window
that allows you to send an email.  The window has
fields for the recipient addresses, CC addresses,
subject and the text itself.

Since this is a GTK+ example, you will have to set
your AIKIDOPATH variable to tell the interpreter
where the GTK+ libaries are if they are not in
your LD_LIBRARY_PATH or in /usr/lib

The program sends a single email and exits.

% setenv AIKIDOPATH <path for aikido libraries>
% aikido emailsender

Note, this won't work on Windows as there is
no command line mailer available as stock.
